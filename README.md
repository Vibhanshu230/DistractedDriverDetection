# DistractedDriverDetection
The rise in traffic fatalities and accidents in recent years has raised serious concerns, which is largely because distracted driving is so common. Three main categories of distraction have been established by numerous studies: visual (driver's eyes off the road), manual (driver's hands off the wheel), and cognitive (driver's mind off the task of driving).

Machine Learning Model to categorize the provided images to different categories of Distraction, this project aims to determine whether the car driver is operating the vehicle safely or engaging in any activity that could cause an accident or any harm to others.

State Farm Distracted Driver Detection, available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection, served as the source of the dataset.
The 10 classes are safe driving, radio operation, drinking, reaching behind, hair and makeup, talking to passenger(s), texting with the right hand, talking on the phone with the right hand, texting with the left hand, and talking on the phone with the left hand.
The Images and the csv files were downloaded from the kaggle website.
